# benfwaves-mod
A client for the XML Waveform format from BenF's DSO Nano firmware The DSO Nano is a small, open-source oscilloscope.
There is an alternate firmware for that oscilloscope called "Benf". That firmware can save waveforms to XML files. 
This project is a simple client to examine and convert those waveforms. Based on the original code that can be found here https://code.google.com/archive/p/benfwaves/
some modifications were made, in order to add FFT functionality on the exported .m files
